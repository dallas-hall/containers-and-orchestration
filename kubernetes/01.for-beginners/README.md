# k8s Application Developer (CKAD) Notes <!-- omit in toc -->

* First course in a series [[beginner](../02.applications-developer/README.md#1-core-concepts), [developer](../02.applications-developer/README.md#2-configuration), [administrator](../03.administrator/README.md), security]

**Note:** This entire course was moved into the [first section of the developers course](../02.applications-developer/README.md#1-core-concepts) because it was entirely recapped there and I merged the 2 together so it was easier to study.
