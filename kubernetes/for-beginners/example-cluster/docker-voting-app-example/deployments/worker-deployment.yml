# Create a Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> Pods
# Using file= kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yml
# Using file and save change history= kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yml --record
# Using image= kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

# Delete Deployment, ReplicaSet, and its Pods
# kubectl delete deployments/my-app-deployment

# Get Deployment information
# kubectl get deployment [dep-name]
# kubectl get rs|replicaset [rs-name]
# kubectl get pod [pod-name]
# kubectl get all
# kubectl describe deployments

# Update Deployments
# Update image version in this file= kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yml
# No file update= kubectl set image deployement/my-deployment nginx=ngninx:1.9.1

# Get Deployment Status
# kubectl rollout status deployment/my-deployment
# kubectl rollout history deployment/my-deployment

# Rollback An Update
# kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-deployment
