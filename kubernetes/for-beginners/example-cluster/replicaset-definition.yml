# This provides Kubernetes a way to ensure n pods are always running.
apiVersion: apps/v1
# ReplicaSet is the new technology, compared to ReplicationController
kind: ReplicaSet
# All Kubernetes yml files need metadata, and they must have name and label.
metadata:
  name: my-app-replica-set
  # Provide your own key/value pairs here.
  # This should match the nested metadata. Helps the Selector manage P ods.
  labels:
    app: my-app
    type: front-end
spec:
  # This is used to tell Kubernetes how to create new Pods. It is basically like pod-definition.yml without apiVersion and kind.
  template:
    metadata:
      name: my-app-pod
      # This should match the parent metadata. Helps the Selector manage Pods.
